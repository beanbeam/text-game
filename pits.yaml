            You slowly stand up and take in your surroundings.
            You realize that you are in an extremely deep, cylindrical pit
            with a smooth stone floor and walls. Almost no light reaches
            you at the bottom.
            
            You can just make out a dark patch on one of the walls that could be a doorway.

            in a matter of seconds.
